.SH DESCRIPTION
This program will add histograms from a list of root files and write them to a target root file.

The target file is newly created and must not exist, or if -f ("force") is given, must not be one of the source files.


.SH OPTIONS
.IP -a
Append to the output
.IP -k
Skip corrupt or non-existent files, do not exit
.IP -T
Do not merge Trees
.IP -O
Re-optimize basket size when merging TTree
.IP -v
Explicitly set the verbosity level: 0 request no output, 99 is the default
.IP -j
Parallelize the execution in multiple processes
.IP -dbg
Parallelize the execution in multiple processes in debug mode (Does not delete partial files stored inside working directory)
.IP -d
Carry out the partial multiprocess execution in the specified directory
.IP -n
Open at most 'maxopenedfiles' at once (use 0 to request to use the system maximum)
.IP -cachesize
Resize the prefetching cache use to speed up I/O operations(use 0 to disable)
.IP -experimental-io-features
Used with an argument provided, enables the corresponding experimental feature for output trees
.IP -f
Gives the ability to specify the compression level of the target file(by default 4) 
.IP -fk
Sets the target file to contain the baskets with the same compression
.IP
as the input files (unless -O is specified). Compresses the meta data
.IP
using the compression level specified in the first input or the
.IP
compression setting after fk (for example 206 when using -fk206)
.IP -ff
The compression level use is the one specified in the first input
.IP -f0
Do not compress the target file
.IP -f6
Use compression level 6. (See TFile::SetCompressionSettings for the support range of value.)
.IP TARGET
Target file
.IP SOURCES
Source files
